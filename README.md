A WeeWX 'skin' for a small display; based on the "Standard" skin.

With thanks to Vince. :-)

This is a simple, easy-to-read "skin" for WeeWx, so that my wife and I can glance
at the display before we take our dog for a walk. It shows us what we want to
know, quickly. It shows

* The current temperature
* The current wind speed
* The peak wind speed in the most recent 30 minutes

Then, since I had more room, I added a few more things we might like to see.

The display is currently optimized for a Raspberry Pi with a 7-inch LCD display
attached.

The only files you need for your WeeWx installation are "skin.conf" and
"index.html.tmpl"; the others are project files.

Here's a pic of it in action (complete with low-voltage warning; I need a new power supply); note that this is a somewhat old version, not exactly as it stands now. Once I stop mucking with it I'll update to a final screenshot.
