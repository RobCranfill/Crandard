A WeeWX 'skin' for a small display; based on the "Standard" skin.

With thanks to Vince. :-)

This is a simple, easy-to-read "skin" for WeeWx, so that my wife and I can glance
at the display before we take our dog for a walk. It shows us what we want to
know, quickly. It shows

The current temperature
The current wind wind speed
The peak wind speed in the most recent 30 minutes

Then, since I had more room, I added a few more things we might like to see.

The display is currently optimized for a Raspberry Pi with a 7-inch LCD display
attached.

Here's a pic of it in action:
